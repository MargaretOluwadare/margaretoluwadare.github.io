Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in applying Computaational statistics methodologies in healthcare, Cancer research, Biogenetcs and Ecological life science.
I am also interested in developing Bayesian methods using Probabilistic Graphical models that are computationally efficient and have theoretical guaranteesin the stated research areas. My recent work is focused on applying flexible Bayesian methods and efficient computational algorithms for big data sets, tailored for both their complexity and size. Motivating examples include big data in genomics, geostatistics, and biomedical databases. Simultaneously optimizing for the size and complexity is a challenge with current Bayesian methods. I am developing novel and computationally tractable Bayesian methods using principles from machine learning and asymptotic Bayesian statistics. 

You can find my articles on [RPUB](https://rpubs.com/moluwadare). 

You can find the code for most of the manuscripts at [Github](https://github.com/margaretoluwadareea).
