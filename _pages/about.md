I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://stat.uiowa.edu/) at [The University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) ([*Go Hawkeyes!*](https://hawkeyesports.com/)). Before coming to Iowa, I have pursued post-doctoral research at [SAMSI](www.samsi.info) and [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu) under the guidance of [David Dunson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunson) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/bee). I have received my Ph.D. in Statistics in August, 2013 from [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/), where I won the I.W. Burr Award for "*promise of contribution to the profession as evidenced by academic excellence in courses and exams, by the quality of research, and by excellence in teaching and consulting.*** I have extensive experience in collaborating with scientists and teaching statistics to students from diverse areas and varied expertise.

Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in developing Bayesian methods that are computationally efficient and have theoretical guarantees. My recent work is focused on developing flexible Bayesian methods and efficient computational algorithms for big data sets, tailored for both their complexity and size. Motivating examples include big data in genomics, geostatistics, and biomedical databases. Simultaneously optimizing for the size and complexity is a challenge with current Bayesian methods. I am developing novel and computationally tractable Bayesian methods using principles from machine learning and asymptotic Bayesian statistics. 

Collaborators
------

I have been extremely lucky to have some of the most talented collaborators. Working with them has significantly impacted my growth as a researcher and improved the quality of my work. I am actively collaborating with
