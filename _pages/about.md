I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://stat.uiowa.edu/) at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) ([*Go Hawkeyes!*](https://hawkeyesports.com/)). Before coming to Iowa in Fall 2015, I  pursued post-doctoral research at [SAMSI](www.samsi.info) and [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu) under [David Dunson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunson) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/bee). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2013 from [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) under the guidance of [Rebecca Doerge](https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/people/dean-bio.html). My academic journey in Statistics started at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/), where I received a five year integrated M.Sc. in Mathematics and Scientific Computing in 2007.

My current research interests are focused on scalable Bayesian computations and dimension reduction. I have focused on scaling posterior computations using the divide-and-conquer technique. Recently, I have been interested in the applications of Gaussian processes for biomedical data analysis. 

I have extensive experience in collaborating with scientists and teaching statistics to students from diverse areas and varied expertise. I am working closely with many colleagues at Iowa. I have developed and taught a class on statistical learning at at the University of Iowa since Fall 2016.
