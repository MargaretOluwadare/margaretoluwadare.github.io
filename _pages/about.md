I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://stat.uiowa.edu/) at [The University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) ([*Go Hawkeyes!*](https://hawkeyesports.com/)). Before coming to Iowa, I have pursued post-doctoral research at [SAMSI](www.samsi.info) and [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu) under the guidance of [David Dunson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunson) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/bee). I have received my Ph.D. in Statistics in August, 2013 from [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/), where I won the I.W. Burr Award for "*promise of contribution to the profession as evidenced by academic excellence in courses and exams, by the quality of research, and by excellence in teaching and consulting*." I have extensive experience in collaborating with scientists and teaching statistics to students from diverse areas and varied expertise.
